# BombWar-MiniGame
A prototype minigame that I've made back in 2015.

## Things I've possibly learnt from this project:
- Learned about bump.lua
- Implemented 2 players joysticks support.
- Used a light and shadows library.
- The first LÃ–VE project with sounds, they were just "stolen" from the bump.lua demos.
